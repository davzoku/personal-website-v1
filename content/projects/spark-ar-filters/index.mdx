## Filters

I have released 5 filters as of this writing. The filters are based on my Lightroom presets or [LUTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookup_table), which I previously used to achieve a consistent look in my photos. They are primarily designed for my convenience.

### Filters Pro

Filters Pro is designed with the power user in mind. Using finger gestures, the
user can fine-tune various settings.

**Features include:**

- Slide left and right to go through filter options ([Adventure Club](#adventure-club), [Indoor Blues](#indoor-blues), [Offblack Nostalgia](#offblack-nostalgia), [Aerochrome Purples](#aerochrome-purples))
- Slide up and down to control the intensity of the selected filter
- Tap to toggle date time widget
- Drag and drop to move date time widget
- Tap and hold to toggle [Bloom effect](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_(shader_effect)>)

_Note:_

- The functionality of resizing the date widget has been removed to retain the default [pinch-to-zoom gesture](/garden/learn-spark-ar-in-public#3-understanding-gestures).

As it utilizes advanced capabilities from Spark AR Studio, the filter is only available for stories, reels, posts and messages on Instagram and Facebook.

### Adventure Club

My go-to filter for photos / videos taken in the outdoors. It has a greenish-yellow warm colour signature that emphasizes the summer vibes.

This filter is available on all platforms, including real-time calls and existing media.

### Indoor Blues

This filter digitally alters the hues to resemble the now-discontinued [Kodak Aerochrome](https://www.thephoblographer.com/2013/01/30/what-is-kodak-aerochrome-a-beginners-guide-to-the-confusion-of-lomochrome-purple/) film, which is popular among infrared photographers. Blue skies have a slight purple tint to emphasize the surreal effect.

This filter is available on all platforms, including real-time calls and existing media.
