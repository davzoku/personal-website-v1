## How I Discovered It

I stumbled upon [this YouTube Video by Grumo Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R94Vnx7yYt4) in August 2021 and I found it very intriguing. Miguel Hernandez created an interactive book summary app for this book using [Glide](https://www.glideapps.com/). Glide is a no-code platform for creators to create mobile-first apps from a Google Sheets in minutes. I am very impressed by the Hernandez's execution and it got me thinking of reading the Tribe of Mentors and using Glide for future side projects.

## Key Highlights

> As often happens at forks in the path—college graduation, quarter-life crisis, midlife crisis, kids leaving home, retirement — **questions started to bubble to the surface.**
>
> Were my goals my own, or simply what I thought I should want? How much of life had I missed from underplanning or overplanning? How could I be kinder to myself? How could I better say no to the noise to better say yes to the adventures I craved? How could I best reassess my life, my priorities, my view of the world, my place in the world, and my trajectory through the world? ...
>
> I wrote down the questions as they came, hoping for a glimmer of clarity. Instead, I felt a wave of anxiety. The list was overwhelming.

Ferris' words hit me. Just a week back, I had the idea of a [Question-based Personal Knowledge Management](/garden/personal-knowledge-management#question-based-pkm). The plan is to collect all the random questions I have in a single list and I would attempt to answer them with what I can find. The initial list is long and I will probably share further as time goes.

> It’s easy to convince yourself that things need to be hard, that if you’re not redlining, you’re not trying hard enough. This leads us to look for paths of most resistance, often creating unnecessary hardship in the process. ... Sometimes, we “solve” the problem by completely reframing it.

Ferris reminds us to take note of [Framing effect](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_(psychology)>) when approaching problems. He continues to recommend us to ask better questions, as specific as possible.

> Success can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations we are willing to have, and by the number of uncomfortable actions we are willing to take. The most fulfilled and effective people I know—world-famous creatives, billionaires, thought leaders, and more—look at their life’s journey as perhaps 25 percent finding themselves and 75 percent creating themselves.

### Steven Pressfield

> The disease of our times is that we live on the surface. We’re like the Platte River, a mile wide and an inch deep. ... Real work and real satisfaction come from the opposite of what the web provides. They come from going deep into something—the book you’re writing, the album, the movie—and staying there for a long, long time.

Success requires deep work.

### Susan Cain

> It’s not that I’d never thought about what else I might like to do other than law, but until I had the time and space to think about life outside the hermetic culture of a law practice, I couldn’t figure out what I really wanted to do.

Take time out to confer with yourself to realign your goals and life purpose.

### Kyle Maynard

> The best way I can describe the feeling is a Finnish word, **“sisu”** — the mental strength to continue to try even after you feel you’ve reached the limits of your abilities.

> His philosophy for hiring people ... He had his employees rate new candidates on a 1–10 scale. The only stipulation was they couldn’t choose 7. It immediately dawned on me how many invitations I was receiving that I would rate as a 7—speeches, weddings, coffees, even dates. If I thought something was a 7, there was a good chance I felt obligated to do it. But if I have to decide between a 6 or an 8, it’s a lot easier to quickly determine whether or not I should even consider it.

[An interesting thread on this topic.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/acow6y/asking_over_8500_students_to_pick_a_random_number/)

Seven tends to be non-committal. When you remove seven, it can either be a six, which is barely a passing grade, or it's an eight, which is very excited. A similar idea is ["Hell Yeah or No"](https://sive.rs/hellyeah).

### Terry Crews

#### On Bad Recommendation

> “Work hard to beat the competition.” The truth is that competition is the opposite of creativity. If I am working hard to beat the competition, it actually prevents me from thinking creatively to make all concepts of competition obsolete.

#### On New Realisations

> I realized that I had to let people leave my life, never to return. Every relationship I have in my life, from family and friends to business partners, must be a **voluntary relationship**.

### Debbie Millman

> When you are operating out of courage, you are saying that no matter how you feel about yourself or your opportunities or the outcome, you are going to take a risk and take a step toward what you want.

#### On Building Career

> You don’t just find and get a great job. You find and win a great job against a pool of very competitive candidates. Finding and winning a great job is a competitive sport that requires as much career athleticism and perseverance as making it to the Olympics. You must be in the finest career shape possible in order to win.

> **Am I doing everything I can—every single day—to stay in “career shape”? If not, what else should I be doing?**

### Naval Ravikant

> Suffering is a moment of clarity, when you can no longer deny the truth of a situation and are forced into uncomfortable change. ... Inside suffering is the seed of change.

> Desire is a contract that you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want. ... Happiness, or at least peace, is the sense that nothing is missing in this moment. No desires running amok. **It’s okay to have a desire. But pick a big one and pick it carefully. Drop the small ones.**

> The genuine love for reading itself, when cultivated, is a superpower. We live in the age of Alexandria, when every book and every piece of knowledge ever written down is a fingertip away. The means of learning are abundant—it’s the desire to learn that’s scarce. Cultivate that desire by reading what you want, not what you’re “supposed to.”

> Do everything you were going to do, but with less angst, less suffering, less emotion. Everything takes time.

#### On Bad Recommendation

> “You’re too young.” Most of history was built by young people. They just got credit when they were older.

### Matt Ridley

> The adult world is not full of gods, just people who have acquired skills and habits that work for them. And specialize—the great human achievement is to specialize as a producer of goods or services so that you can diversify as a consumer. Self-sufficiency is another word for poverty.

I like how he describes the adult world and it is similar to Ravikant's [opinion](/library/tribe-of-mentors#on-bad-recommendation-1).

### Tim Urban

> don’t get daunted out of shooting for something you want, especially by potentially unfounded assumptions.

#### Chefs and Cooks

He describes people who **reason from first principles** as chefs; they experiment with ingredients and develop a new recipe. On the contrary, those who **reason by analogy** are like cooks. They follow someone else’s recipe. He considers Elon Musk unusually cheflike. I have added his book, [The Cook and the Chef](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30339278-the-cook-and-the-chef) to my to-read list.

#### On Writing

He encourages aspiring writers to focus inward and write to an imaginary audience who are just like yourself and do not give on your uniqueness. Your readers will eventually find their way to you,

### Janna Levin

> life is the obstacles. There is no underlying path. Our role here is to get better at navigating those obstacles. I strive to find calm, measured responses and to see hindrances as a chance to problem-solve. Often I fall back into old frustrations, but if I remind myself, this is a chance to step up, I can reframe conflicts as a chance to experiment with solutions.

Levin also emphasizes the power of framing effects just like Ferris.

### Graham Duncan

There are 3 mental models that influenced Duncan's way of thinking about people and teams.

Duncan found the [Big Five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) or OCEAN model useful in understand what makes people tick. High open-minded, high conscientious, low neurotic is the killer combination in his opinion.

The second mental model is Harvard professor Robert Kegan’s model of adult development. Kegan argues adults develop—and make sense of reality—in five discrete phases. I am adding [Changing on the Job](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13127496-changing-on-the-job) to my to-read list.

The third mental model is from the website, [Work With Source](https://workwithsource.com/) by Peter Koenig. They argued that there is always a single "source" in startups, even when there are multiple co-founders. The person took the first risk and has an unique understanding of the original idea. The others that are helping with the execution often lacks this inituitive insight of the vision. Handing over this source role to another is extremely difficult. Koenig observed that the original source must move on and allow the new leader the freedom to execute in his own way to have a successful transition.

Duncan also brought up Dan Siegel's [The River of Integration](https://www.habitsforwellbeing.com/the-river-of-integration-discovering-flow-and-harmony-between-the-chaos-and-rigidity/) in the perspective of career building. Depending on our current circumstances, we always have the option to course-correct and swim towards structure or chaos.
