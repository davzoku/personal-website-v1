## How I Discovered It

I stumbled upon [this YouTube Video by Grumo Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R94Vnx7yYt4) in August 2021 and I found it very intriguing. Miguel Hernandez created an interactive book summary app for this book using [Glide](https://www.glideapps.com/). Glide is a no-code platform for creators to create mobile-first apps from a Google Sheets in minutes. I am very impressed by the Hernandez's execution and it got me thinking of reading the Tribe of Mentors and using Glide for future side projects.

## Key Highlights

> As often happens at forks in the path—college graduation, quarter-life crisis, midlife crisis, kids leaving home, retirement — **questions started to bubble to the surface.**
>
> Were my goals my own, or simply what I thought I should want? How much of life had I missed from underplanning or overplanning? How could I be kinder to myself? How could I better say no to the noise to better say yes to the adventures I craved? How could I best reassess my life, my priorities, my view of the world, my place in the world, and my trajectory through the world? ...

> I wrote down the questions as they came, hoping for a glimmer of clarity. Instead, I felt a wave of anxiety. The list was overwhelming.

Ferris' words hit me. Just a week back, I had the idea of a [Question-based Personal Knowledge Management](/garden/personal-knowledge-management#question-based-pkm). The plan is to collect all the random questions I have in a single list and I would attempt to answer them with what I can find. The initial list is long and I will probably share further as time goes.

> It’s easy to convince yourself that things need to be hard, that if you’re not redlining, you’re not trying hard enough. This leads us to look for paths of most resistance, often creating unnecessary hardship in the process. ... Sometimes, we “solve” the problem by completely reframing it.

Ferris reminds us to take note of [Framing effect](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_(psychology)>) when approaching problems. He continues to recommend us to ask better questions, as specific as possible.

> Success can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations we are willing to have, and by the number of uncomfortable actions we are willing to take. The most fulfilled and effective people I know—world-famous creatives, billionaires, thought leaders, and more—look at their life’s journey as perhaps 25 percent finding themselves and 75 percent creating themselves.

### Steven Pressfield

> The disease of our times is that we live on the surface. We’re like the Platte River, a mile wide and an inch deep. ... Real work and real satisfaction come from the opposite of what the web provides. They come from going deep into something—the book you’re writing, the album, the movie—and staying there for a long, long time.

Success requires deep work.

### Susan Cain

> It’s not that I’d never thought about what else I might like to do other than law, but until I had the time and space to think about life outside the hermetic culture of a law practice, I couldn’t figure out what I really wanted to do.

Take time out to confer with yourself to realign your goals and life purpose.

### Kyle Maynard

> The best way I can describe the feeling is a Finnish word, **“sisu”** — the mental strength to continue to try even after you feel you’ve reached the limits of your abilities.

> His philosophy for hiring people ... He had his employees rate new candidates on a 1–10 scale. The only stipulation was they couldn’t choose 7. It immediately dawned on me how many invitations I was receiving that I would rate as a 7—speeches, weddings, coffees, even dates. If I thought something was a 7, there was a good chance I felt obligated to do it. But if I have to decide between a 6 or an 8, it’s a lot easier to quickly determine whether or not I should even consider it.

### Terry Crews

#### On bad recommendation

> “Work hard to beat the competition.” The truth is that competition is the opposite of creativity. If I am working hard to beat the competition, it actually prevents me from thinking creatively to make all concepts of competition obsolete.

#### On new realisations

> I realized that I had to let people leave my life, never to return. Every relationship I have in my life, from family and friends to business partners, must be a **voluntary relationship**.

### Debbie Millman

> When you are operating out of courage, you are saying that no matter how you feel about yourself or your opportunities or the outcome, you are going to take a risk and take a step toward what you want.

#### On Building Career

> You don’t just find and get a great job. You find and win a great job against a pool of very competitive candidates. Finding and winning a great job is a competitive sport that requires as much career athleticism and perseverance as making it to the Olympics. You must be in the finest career shape possible in order to win.
