## How I Discovered It

I discovered this book on GoodReads after I completed the book, [Mastery by Robert Greene](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13589182-mastery). I was looking for an apprenticeship related book in the Software Engineering field and this came top on the list. Along with this discovery, I also found the [Epic CTO Reading List](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/36429.Epic_CTO_Reading_List) which contains other SWE-related books for future reading.

## Who Should Read it

I feel that it is a good read for anyone who is in the software engineering field, regardless of experience. I would recommend this book for newcomers, especially students who are interning or looking for internship as a software engineer. It really helps in putting you in the right mindset for the internship. It is one of the books that I have wished I had read earlier.

The authors emphasized this about the usage of this book,
_"This book is not meant to be used as a reference, but is more like an artist’s source book—you can dip into it for inspiration from time to time. You might even invent some new approach to using this book that we haven’t thought of."_

## Key Ideas

### Why Use Pattern Approach to Apprenticeship

A pattern is a name for a recurring solution to a problem in a particular context.

> Just like how we apply design patterns in our work to solve common engineering problems, the use of pattern language can help us rethink how we think about our career as a whole.

It is an important reminder that any pattern is intended to contain a family of solutions to a family of problems within a specific context. **Patterns are meant to be modified to fit your needs rather than being applied mechanically.** Be prepared to expect different results even when you apply them in similar context. Instead of thinking them as algorithms that always return the same result, imagine apprenticeship patterns as tools to solve one set of problems while creating new ones. The trick is to use your discretion in selecting the problems you prefer.

> A pattern language gives each person who uses it the power to create an infinite variety of new and unique buildings, just as his ordinary language gives him the power to create an infinite variety of sentences.

### Apprentice, Journeyman, Master

### Apprentice

> **The modern concept of apprenticeship is mainly a frame of mind**: you recognize that you are still at the beginning, even if you’ve been programming for several years, and you are prepared to take steps to create your apprenticeship out of the circumstances you are in. ... **In reality, most people have to claw and scratch their apprenticeships out of less-than-ideal situations.** They might be facing overbearing and/or incompetent managers, de-motivated coworkers, impossible deadlines, and work environments that treat novice developers like workhorses, storing them in small, rectangular stalls with a PC and a crippled Internet connection.

An apprenticeship is a period in your career when your primary focus is on your own development rather than anything else. This is the time to prioritize learning opportunities over earning potential.

1. Have the mindset that there is always a better/smarter/faster way to do what you just did or what you're doing now: **Keep a lookout for people, companies and situations that will force you to learn better/smarter/faster.**

2. **Value learning over the appearance of smartness**, to enjoy a challenge, and to use mistakes as stepping stones to mastery.

3. Learn to grow yourself, **learn how to learn**

When that period is over, you will have to adapt. Despite the fact that you still have a lot to learn, you will no longer be an apprentice, and your priorities will need to shift towards more outward-looking responsibilities.

#### Journeyman

- An added focus on the connections between practitioners, the communication channels within and outside the team. This focus will eventually lead to the responsibility of mentoring those around you and communicating with the rest of the industry.

> The journeyman is focused on building an ever-larger portfolio of applications that demonstrates his progress in the craft; he moves between projects and masters, seeking to diversify and deepen his portfolio; he seeks to elevate his status within the community; and he strives to become ready to be a master.

- Build a portfolio of applications to demonstrate your craftswork. Seek to diversify and deepen your expertise

#### Master

- **An focus on moving the industry forward.** This could be in the form of developing new tools that get to the heart of software development, or it could be in the form of training a new generation of journeymen whose skills equal and then surpass your own.

### 10 Overlapping Values of Software Craftsmanship

A collection of values that the authors find in highly competent people and hope to see more in the dev community.

1. [Have a growth mindset](http://localhost:8000/library/growth-mindset)
2. Adaptive to feedback
3. Choose pragmatic over dogmatic: This reminds me of [Good Enough](https://www.swyx.io/good-enough/).
4. Share knowledge
5. A willingness to experiment and be proven wrong
6. Have an internal locus of control: be in control and responsibility of what we can accomplish
7. A focus on individuals rather than groups: This is not a movement with leaders and followers.
8. A commitment to inclusiveness to identify and absorb the best ideas from all areas of the dev community.
9. Choose skill-centric over process-centric: no process or tool is going to make everyone equally successful. It is more important to pick up valuable skills.
10. Be in a community of practice
