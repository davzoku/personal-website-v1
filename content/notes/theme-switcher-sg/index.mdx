## The Idea

Supporting dark mode is part of the [roadmap](/how-i-built-my-website-v1#roadmap) for my website. After some research, I found Max BÃ¶ck's implementation of a [color them switcher](https://mxb.dev/blog/color-theme-switcher/). The execution and the beautiful design widget to toggle themes really blew my mind. _Mario Kart 64 race tracks really make a good choice for themes._

Click on the **paint-roller button** above to try it!

_If you are reading this from somewhere else, this is what it will do:_

As Max's website uses [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) while mine is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), the guide below will vary in implementation.

## Design Exploration

Like how his themes are based on Mario Kart race tracks, I needed a central topic across my themes. After a travel-less year because of COVID-19, many of us have probably explored most tourist spots in our current location. In my home country, Singapore, adult citizens were given [SingapoRediscover Vouchers](https://singaporediscovers.life.gov.sg/) to support local tourism businesses. I have enjoyed my time at some of these places, thanks to this initiative. _ðŸ’¡ tadaa~, I have an idea now!_

After going through the list of Singapore attractions, I shortlisted 5 with distinct color hues and extracted 8 colors to form individual color swatches using Figma.

### Merlion

I picked [Merlion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlion) for the default light theme,

### Night Safari

[Night Safari](https://www.wrs.com.sg/en/night-safari.html) for the default dark theme,

### Garden by the Bay

[Gardens by the Bay](https://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/en.html) for the natural theme,

### Chinatown

[Chinatown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown,_Singapore) for its distinct look _(inspired by the Chinatown Maroon in Jonathan Tan's [Singapore Pantone](https://cargocollective.com/jontan/Singapore-Pantone) project)_,

### Sentosa

and, lastly, [Sentosa](https://www.sentosa.com.sg/) for the relaxing beachy vibes.

### Color Picking

To keep things simple, I picked 8 colors for each theme, just like Max have done. Having 8 colors is manageable and I find it sufficent for my website's design. You can have any number of colors as you see fit.

```css
  --color-primary: for links
  --color-secondary: for ::selection selector
  --color-text: for normal text
  --color-border: for border
  --color-background: for main background
  --color-primaryOffset: for hover links;
  --color-textOffset: for emphasized text like sub-headings;
  --color-backgroundOffset: for components which requires some background constrast like cards and code blocks;
```

We can use any online image color picker like [this](https://coolors.co/image-picker) to help us pick the dominant colors from an image. However, after some trial and error, I decided to do it manually using Figma so I can see how the selection of colors would look together on a page.

Depending on how you decide to group the colors on your site, some implicit color rules have to be considered when finalizing the color swatches. For example, text color, primary color and primary offset color have to be distinct from background and background offset color to ensure the site's readability.

## Implementation

### Setting up gatsby-plugin-theme-switcher

Fortunately, Ruben Casas created the [gatsby-plugin-theme-switcher](https://github.com/infoxicator/gatsby-plugin-theme-switcher) plugin which made the implementation of a theme switcher with Gatsby straightforward.

After installing `gatsby-plugin-theme-switcher`, we can add the plugin to our `gatsby-config.js`.

Reuben provided a helpful feature in which we can declare our defaultDarkTheme and defaultLightTheme. The defaultDarkTheme takes advantage of the CSS media feature, [prefers-color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme). If the user has indicated the dark preference through the system or user agent setting, the user will be greeted with the defaultDarkTheme first.

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "gatsby-plugin-theme-switcher",
      options: {
        defaultDarkTheme: "theme-merlion",
        defaultLightTheme: "theme-night-safari",
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

Next, we can arrange our color palettes from above into CSS variable with the `.theme-*` format.

```css
.theme-night-safari {
  --color-primary: #ffb814;
  --color-secondary: #10c8ee;
  --color-text: #f5f5ff;
  --color-border: #10c8ee;
  --color-background: #16161a;
  --color-primaryOffset: #bee71f;
  --color-textOffset: #16161a;
  --color-backgroundOffset: #404043;

  --color-logo-text: #ffffff;
  --color-logo-circle: #ca8d00;
  --color-logo-ring: #ffb814;
}
```

Subsequently, we have to change every color attribute in our CSS to use the CSS variables that we have declared. _Yes, every single one of them!_

```css
  body {
    width: 100%;
    margin: 0 auto;
    font-size: 16px;
    line-height: 1.5;
    color: var(--color-text, #16161a);
    background: var(--color-background, #ffffff);
    -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;

    @media (max-width: ${dimensions.maxwidthMobile}px) {
      font-size: 14px;
    }
```

### Toggle SVG Colors

Additionally, if we have any SVG icons that we want to toggle alongside with the themes, we can change the fill attribute to take in the CSS variable.

For example, my site icon is a SVG which should change along with the theme ideally.

<BasicImage
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wtkw/image/upload/v1626932163/waltertengcom/garden/theme-switcher-sg/svg_icons_ezpbdo.png"
  alt="toggling svg icons"
/>

Instead of generating multiple image assets, we can modify the SVG code to accept a CSS variable.

```markup
  <svg
    width="31"
    height="31"
    viewBox="0 0 31 31"
    fill="none"
    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  >
    <path
      d="M15.5 31C24.0604 31 31 24.0604 31 15.5C31 6.93959 24.0604 0 15.5 0C6.93959 0 0 6.93959 0 15.5C0 24.0604 6.93959 31 15.5 31Z"
      fill="var(--color-logo-ring, #4B84E5)"
    />
    ...
  </svg>
```

### Building UI Component

Finally, we can build either a theme toggler or a theme picker UI component for the user to change themes. I have built both types of components, and you can find these components in [my Github repo](https://github.com/davzoku/personal-website-v1). The theme toggler method is also provided as an example in docs by Reuben.

Since I have opted to find a theme picker inspired by Max's UI design, I will further discuss it.

First, we can create a hashmap to represent all the available theme options, each containing the theme name and the SVG icon.

```js
const allThemes = new Map([
  ["Merlion", MIcon],
  ["Night Safari", NSIcon],
  ["Garden by the Bay", GBTBIcon],
  ["Chinatown", CTIcon],
  ["Sentosa Sunset", SSIcon],
])
```

We will loop through the map and create a `ThemeButton` component for each item in the map.

```js
const ThemePicker = ({ theme, setTheme }) => {
  return (
    <ThemeButtons>
      <ReactTooltip />

      {[...allThemes].map((item) => {
        let name = item[0]
        let svg = item[1]
        const themeVal = name.toLowerCase().replace(/ /g, "-")

        return (
          <ThemeButton
            key={name}
            className={`theme-${themeVal}`}
            aria-label={`Theme ${name}`}
            className={`${
              theme === `theme-${themeVal}` ? "selectedTheme" : ""
            }`}
            onClick={() => setTheme(`theme-${themeVal}`)}
          >
            <div data-tip={`${name}`}>
              <img src={svg} />
            </div>
            <ThemeName
              className={`${
                theme === `theme-${themeVal}` ? "selectedThemeText" : ""
              }`}
            >
              {name}
            </ThemeName>
          </ThemeButton>
        )
      })}
    </ThemeButtons>
  )
}
```

To switch themes, we can use the `ThemeContext`.

```js
import React, { useContext } from "react"
import { ThemeContext } from 'gatsby-plugin-theme-switcher';
...
const { theme, switchTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext)
...
<ThemePicker theme={theme} setTheme={switchTheme} />
```

The remaining step is to apply CSS for the ThemePicker component and it is dependent on the look on that you are trying to achieve.

_I would like your feedback! Other than the Merlion and Night Safari theme, I am unsure how the remaining themes fares in terms of color accessibility. If you find that the color combination is affecting the siteâ€™s readability, please reach out so that I can improve on it._ ðŸ˜€

## Bonus

Below is a snapshot of my Figma screen behind the scenes while I was picking suitable color combinations and creating the image assets. _The color styles feature is a lifesaver!_
