## Motivation

"Draw with Walter" _(or [@drawwithwalter](https://www.instagram.com/drawwithwalter/) on Instagram)_ is a series in which I embark on a journey to learn to draw (again). There are several motivations behind starting this adventure; I will probably elaborate further as I go along. The driving inspiration comes from [Scott Young's 30 Day Portrait Drawing Challenge](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/portrait-challenge/) for showing me that drawing is a learnable skill and this learning journey serves as a means for me to [practice what I read](/growth-mindset).

## Tools

Contrary to Young's challenge, I will focus my learning solely on the digital medium using the tools below.

- iPad Pro
- Apple Pencil
- Procreate

## Learning Topics

Below are some learning topics that I have categorized after browsing at the general tutorial content about Procreate on Youtube. I have roughly arranged them based on the perceived difficulty and my skill level.

- [Digital Marbling](/garden/digital-marbling)
- [Digital One Line Drawings](/garden/digital-one-line-drawings)
- Digital Watercoloring
- Digital Lettering
- Digital Illustration
- Colouring and Shading
- Realistic Drawing
