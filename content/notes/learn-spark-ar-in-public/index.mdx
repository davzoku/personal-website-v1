## Introduction

[Spark AR Studio](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/) is an application developed by Meta to create AR filters on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Other social media AR app includes [Lens Studio](https://ar.snap.com/) for Snapchat and [Effect House](https://effecthouse.tiktok.com/) for TikTok.

## Motivation

I have always dreamt of creating my own Instagram filter in 2019-2020. My action plan is to migrate my existing Lightroom presets into Instagram compatible filters as a starter project and explore further once I have familiarized myself with Spark AR basics.

I finally put things into action and recently created my [Spark AR Filters](https://walterteng.com/spark-ar-filters) in 2022.

## Learning Points

Here are some of my learning points from my first starter project:

### 1. Always plan for the target platforms before developing your filter

- There are 3 types of experiences that Spark AR filters can support on Facebook and Instagram
  1. Sharing new experiences on stories, reels, posts or messages
  2. Real-time video experience for real-time video calls
  3. Existing Media (Applying filters on saved images or videos)
- All capabilities and patches are available for sharing new experiences, and the availability of capabilities reduces as you go down the list.
- For example, filters cannot be applied to existing media if the filters use native UI like [UI Picker](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/learn/tutorials/native-ui-picker/) or [UI Slider](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/learn/tutorials/native-ui-slider/)

### 2. The option is to apply filter on existing media is precious

- If a filter has been published with capabilities that are not compatible with existing media, updating the published filter with a backward-compatible project will not bring back to option to apply the filter to existing media.

- There is no known workaround for this. I have to resubmit my filters as a new submission to get the option to apply for existing media.

## Resources

This section documents a list of valuable resources that I have used to pick up this skill:

- [DJS CREATES](https://www.youtube.com/user/ddanyy95) : High-quality Spark AR tutorials in bite-size format

- [Eddy Adams](https://www.youtube.com/c/EddyAdamsin3d): Most comprehensive masterclass about Spark AR on YouTube

- [Udart](https://www.youtube.com/c/Udart): Deep-dive on various patches for a thorough understanding
