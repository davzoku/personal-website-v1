## Introduction

[Spark AR Studio](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/) is an application developed by Meta to create AR filters on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Other social media AR app includes [Lens Studio](https://ar.snap.com/) for Snapchat and [Effect House](https://effecthouse.tiktok.com/) for TikTok.

## Motivation

I have always dreamt of creating my own Instagram filter in 2019-2020. My action plan is to migrate my existing Lightroom presets into Instagram compatible filters as a starter project and explore further once I have familiarized myself with Spark AR basics.

I finally put things into action and recently created my [Spark AR Filters](/spark-ar-filters) in 2022.

## Learning Points

Here are some of my learning points from my first starter project:

### 1. Always plan for the target platforms before developing your filter

- There are 3 types of experiences that Spark AR filters can support on Facebook and Instagram
  1. Sharing new experiences on stories, reels, posts or messages
  2. Real-time video experience for real-time video calls
  3. Existing Media (Applying filters on saved images or videos)
- All capabilities and patches are available for sharing new experiences, and the availability of capabilities reduces as you go down the list.
- For example, filters cannot be applied to existing media if the filters use native UI like [UI Picker](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/learn/tutorials/native-ui-picker/) or [UI Slider](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/learn/tutorials/native-ui-slider/)

### 2. The option is to apply filter on existing media is precious

- If a filter has been published with capabilities that are not compatible with existing media, updating the published filter with a backward-compatible project will not bring back to option to apply the filter to existing media.

- There is no known workaround for this. I have to resubmit my filters as a new submission to get the option to apply for existing media.

### 3. Understanding gestures

There are 5 [gestures](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/learn/reference/classes/touchgesturesmodule.gesture) available on Spark AR.

These gestures are :

- [Tap](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/learn/reference/classes/touchgesturesmodule.tapgesture)

  - Most common in filters. Users can tap the screen to toggle a setting or cycle through a list of settings.

- [Pan](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/learn/reference/classes/touchgesturesmodule.pangesture)

  - Can also be understood as a tap and drag gesture. Typically used to drag and drop a prop around the viewport.

- [Long Press](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/learn/reference/classes/touchgesturesmodule.longpressgesture)

  - An alternative to Tap. It is less intuitive than Tap, but it can be used to add additional functionality to the filter.

- [Pinch](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/learn/reference/classes/touchgesturesmodule.pinchgesture)

  - Typically used to resize a prop. **However, the default gesture, pinch to zoom, will not longer work if this gesture is enabled.**

- [Rotate](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/learn/reference/classes/touchgesturesmodule.rotategesture)

  - 2-Finger-Rotate. Least common in filters, can be used to skew or rotate the orientation of a prop.

### Instructions is key

- Keep any interactions or gestures as intuitive as possible.
- Include [instructions](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/learn/reference/classes/InstructionModule) as much as possible.
- Understand the differences between [Automatic Instructions](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/learn/articles/camera-settings/automatic-instructions) and [Custom Instructions](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/learn/articles/camera-settings/instructions). Use them wisely and avoid overlaps for better user experience.
