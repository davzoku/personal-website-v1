Walter's Questions is my implementation of a [Question-based PKM](/garden/personal-knowledge-management#question-based-pkm). Below are some of my evergreen questions that I always have, consolidated in a single note.

## Better Thinking

### What are some good mindsets to adopt?

Long form: [Better Mindsets](/garden/better-mindsets)

**TLDR**

- **Growth Mindset:**
  - have a passion for learning, rather than a hunger for approval. The human potential is unknown, it's impossible to predict what years of passion, toil, and training can accomplish.
- **Abundance Mindset:**
  - think collaboratively; think win-win; there is plenty for everybody.
- **Outward Mindset:**
  - see beyond ourselves and focus on the needs, objectives, and challenges of others
- **Beginner's Mindset:**
  - approach ideas with a fresh mind, teach from the student's perspective.
- **Scout Mindset:**
  - the motivation to see things as they are, not as you wish they were.
