## Coining the Term

After creating my digital garden, I had the idea of dedicating a sub-section for books, similar to what [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/) has done on her personal website. At the same time, I was introduced to the concepts of the [Lindy Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect) and Lindy Libraries from the [Coding Career Circle](https://codingcareer.circle.so/c/lindy-library). The Lindy Effect is the idea that the future life expectancy of non-perishable things like books, technologies and ideas is proportional to their current age. A Lindy Library, as Swyx puts it, is an annex of content that stood the test of time.

Building a Lindy Library sounds awesome, but that isn't my goal. The objective of my public library is to share my thoughts and notes on a curated list of books that I find insightful and have a lasting impact on how I see and view things. I want to encourage more conversations and discussions by making it public. In other words, this library that I am building is a collection of books that resonated with me.

The term, Resonance Library, is an amalgamation of "Lindy Library" and "Resonance Calendar". A [Resonance Calendar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKYBB-Uw1IM) is how Ali Abdaal manages and reflects on all the content he consumes that resonated with him.

## Finding Good Books

Over time, I realised there are 3 main ways I discover new books that I potenially want to read:

1. Podcasts (People recommending books that inspire them, authors talking about their own book)
2. Blinkist summaries that I find interesting for deeper dive
3. Browsing on Goodreads etc.

In particular, I am more inclined to pick up the book if I have heard the author talk about it first. You can almost hear the enthusiasm and eagerness in their voices to share their ideas. I like to listen to their thought process in their own voice; it feels more personal and it becomes more memorable for me that way.

I have organized these podcasts into 2 different Spotify playlists for those who are interested too. They are categorized into

**[General](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1D3BYlBzO8Em2xh7d965Bz):** Mostly self-help, business

<SpotifyPlaylistEmbed src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/1D3BYlBzO8Em2xh7d965Bz" />

**[SWE](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3OrqnhAeVXce4mLRJrG4lA):** Software Engineering related

Do you have a book to recommend for me?
