## Discovery

I first heard of "digital garden" when I stumbled upon Tom Critchlow's posts, [Of Digital Streams, Campfires and Gardens](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/) and [Building a digital garden](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/) in May 2021. He described that the online information could be broadly categorized into **Streams** (Tweets), **Campfires** (blogging) and **Gardens** (personal public wiki).

Illustrating with the concept of [stock and flow](http://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890), blogging and tweets make up the flow; a stream of regular updates that reminds people you exist. Stock, on the other hand, is more durable. It is the content you produce that stays interesting regardless of time. Notes/wikis fall in this category.

The second characteristic of a digital garden captivates me the most. It promotes a space to cultivate and edit ideas/notes in real-time as my thinking evolves. It doesn't strive for perfection from the beginning. Notes can be unpolished (**Seedling**), developing (**Budding**) or completed (**Evergreen**). Essentially, it is a form of open-access writing without the pressure of the publish button.

At this point, I was interested about what other digital gardeners are doing and how they started their gardens. I listened to the [recorded Clubhouse chat](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5yzVXokuaDj3M973XucZGy?si=vZm1dRE0RxqS-vQG6dLxew&dl_branch=1) between [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com) and [Swyx](https://www.swyx.io/). It was very thought-provoking, and I finally found my way to start mine.

## Starting From Abundance

I have been tinkering with [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) for over a year now. The goal was to build my version of a private [Personal Knowledge Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) (PKM) system with borrowed concepts from [August Bradley](https://www.youtube.com/user/augustbradley) and [Tiago Forte](https://www.youtube.com/user/simulacrumsquared). I have accumulated a sizable amount of notes/wiki on different subjects, which resembles a digital garden. The only issue is that most of these notes are _very_ unpolished and not ready for the world. Nonetheless, I can start from abundance.

I am starting to see the benefit of maintaining a private and public PKM. The private PKM (Second Brain) serves as a central repository of my knowledge vault, while the public PKM (Digital Garden) will serve as a space for me to share a curated list of public notes for knowledge sharing and discussions.

## Sharing Gardening Tools

I hope by sharing my experience, you will be encouraged to start your garden or come up with your version of open-access writing.
