## Documentation is a mental map

After working on several software projects, I brood over the notion of what constitutes good documentation. Each software project is unique, and even software that shares similar architectures and functionalities may require a different set of documentation to point out the differences.

Documentation provides a mental map and a starting point for new users to interact with or modify parts of the software.

## Tips

Here are a collection of tips that other developers are sharing on good documentation:

### 1. Start with writing self-documenting code

Having a self-documenting codebase that adheres to some form of [coding guidelines](https://github.com/alibaba/Alibaba-Java-Coding-Guidelines) can improve the readability and understandability of the code.

Some tips from Mike Cronin on writing [self-documenting code](https://itnext.io/tips-for-writing-self-documenting-code-e54a15e9de2)

- Don’t use magic numbers; always give a name for numbers.
- Use clear variable names, avoid using acronyms as much as possible
- Refactor with tiny, named functions; Don't Repeat Yourself

### 2. Write docs with user-centric goals

Swyx reminds us to [write docs with user-centric goals](https://www.swyx.io/documentation-levels/)

- Think about the user profile of your readers

| Users        | Goals                                                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Beginners    | get to success as quickly as possible, avoid/recover from mistakes |
| Intermediate | contrast with comparable projects, learn every API/option          |
| Experts      | keep up with changes and future plans                              |
| Contributors | How to contribute, how the project is setup                        |

### 3. Keep an ARCHITECTURE.md for open-source projects

Aleksey Kladov encourages [adding an ARCHITECTURE.md file](https://matklad.github.io/2021/02/06/ARCHITECTURE.md.html) to describe the high-level architecture of the project. It offers a low-effort high-leverage way for other developers to contribute to the project as it gives them a better understanding of the project.

## Documentation Tools

A collection of documentation tools:

- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/solutions/api-documentation/): Generate documentation for your API endpoints

- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/introduction): A UI component explorer for developing UI components in isolation and documenting component stories

- [readme.so](https://readme.so/): An editor to quickly add and customize all the sections you need for your project's readme
