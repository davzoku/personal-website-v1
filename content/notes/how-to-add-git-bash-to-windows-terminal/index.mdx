## Windows Terminal

Initially released on 3 May 2019, the [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701) offers users a multi-tabbed command-line experience. It can run any Windows terminal emulators in a separate tab. I immediately downloaded the preview version when it first came out after I saw this feature.

By default, Windows Terminal comes with PowerShell, Command Prompt, Azure Cloud Shell and WSL.

I had no idea how to add Git Bash to Windows Terminal, and I searched for a solution. It was only recently when it occurred to me whenever I want to use Git Bash; I am using it standalone. Below is the working steps for me for my future reference.

## Adding Git Bash

1. Go to settings by pressing `Ctrl + , `
2. Click on "Open JSON file"
3. Under the `list` array add the following:

```
{
  "guid": "{00000000-0000-0000-ba54-000000000002}",
  "name": "Git",
  "commandline": "C:/Program Files/Git/bin/bash.exe --login",
  "icon": "%PROGRAMFILES%/Git/mingw64/share/git/git-for-windows.ico",
  "startingDirectory": "%USERPROFILE%",
  "hidden": false
}
```

4. Save the settings.json file

  alt="win terminal with git bash"
/>

These steps can also be used to add other shell profiles.
