## Motivation

At the start of 2022, I enrolled myself on KodeKloud's [Terraform beginner course](https://www.udemy.com/course/terraform-for-the-absolute-beginners/) on Udemy to gain confidence and a good understanding of working with Terraform files written by the DevOps engineering team in my current company.

The concept of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) isn't new to me; however, I lacked the hands-on experience to understand Terraform HCL syntax and create my own Terraform files. While working through the labs exercises from the course, I found myself deeply fascinated by this tool. Henceforth, I decided to push myself to solidify my fundamentals on Terraform and test my understanding via the Terraform Associate Certification. I am a strong believer in the [fail fast, learn fast](https://www.kornferry.com/insights/this-week-in-leadership/fail-fast-learn-fast) methodology.

I am glad to announce that I am a [Terraform Certified Associate](https://www.credly.com/earner/earned/badge/89364b43-ea7b-44a0-a111-0512e99f4aca) after about 4 months of preparation!

## Strategy

Here is my strategy for acing this exam.

### Learn from the Best

1. Enroll in a course that provided both theory and lab exercises eg.
   [Terraform for the Absolute Beginners with Labs](https://www.udemy.com/course/terraform-for-the-absolute-beginners/).

   - I prefer courses from [KodeKloud](https://kodekloud.com/) as they are one of the best resources for learning DevOps related topics.

   - Zeal Vora's [Terraform course](https://www.udemy.com/course/terraform-beginner-to-advanced/) is equally good, but, you have to set up your own AWS account to do the hands-on exercises.

   - **Free Resource:** FreeCodeCamp also have a free [HashiCorp Terraform Associate Certification Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4waklkBC38) on YouTube

2. Get more hands-on experience by building your own Resume Foundations Project (optional)

   - Derek Morgan has a well-crafted course on learning Terraform by [building a useful project](https://courses.morethancertified.com/p/rfp-terraform).

### Internalize Your Learnings

4. Make [your own notes](https://github.com/davzoku/terraformfiles/blob/main/terraform-associate/README.md)!
   - _Taking a certification is not a sprint._ Help your future self by taking smart notes that is easy to reference and recap in the future.

### Be Exam-Smart

5. Go through the [official Terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/intro) to deep dive into the concepts **(Important!)**

6. Understand the exam by going through official articles about the certification:

   - [Study Guide - Terraform Associate Certification](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/associate-study?in=terraform/certification)
   - [Sample Questions - Terraform Associate Certification](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/associate-questions?in=terraform/certification)
   - [Exam Review - Terraform Associate Certification](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/associate-review?in=terraform/certification)

7. Take practice exams

- The questions from Bryan Krausen's [practice exams](https://www.udemy.com/course/terraform-associate-practice-exam/) are good and every question comes with a detailed explaination.

8. Build confidence by seeing how others have succeeded before you:
