_This is part of the "Setting Up a Cross-Platform Development Experience" series, where I simplify my own user experience across my macOS and Windows machines for general use and software development._

One of the long-time arguments that favor macOS over Windows for developers is that macOS Terminal can run Unix commands while Windows Command Prompt cannot. However, since most servers worldwide are UNIX-based, it is common advice for developers to be familiar with Unix commands as much as possible.

Today, this argument holds little weight as there are plenty of ways Windows users can install a Unix shell like bash easily with
[Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) and [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

As macOS has [replaced bash with zsh since Catalina](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18651872/apple-macos-catalina-zsh-bash-shell-replacement-features), I decided to use zsh on Windows too, so that I have an unified experience across 2 different OS, with the same (or similar) `.zshrc` config.

It turns out it is not as straightforward as I initially thought.

> TLDR: My advice is to stick with git bash for Windows as it is good enough for most cases. (See my 1-minute guide on [How to add Git Bash to Windows Terminal](/garden/how-to-add-git-bash-to-windows-terminal)) If you are as experimental as I am, please proceed ahead.

There are 2 options to install zsh on Windows. We can either [install zsh on WSL](#install-zsh-on-wsl) or [replace the git bash shell with zsh](#replace-git-bash-with-zsh). _See [Git Bash vs WSL](https://www.reddit.com/r/git/comments/fkpjou/windows_git_bash_vs_cygwin_vs_windows_subsystem/)_.

## Prerequisties

You may need these software installed on your Windows machine to follow this guide.

- [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701)
- [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)
- [Windows Subsytem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

## Install zsh on WSL

> Use this method if you are already using WSL for most of your stuff.

This is the easier option; we just have to run the following commands in the Ubuntu shell.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install zsh -y
# install oh-my-zsh to set zsh as default shell and install plugins
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

You are good to go at this point. You may continue to watch the following video or read the [companion blog post](https://www.the-digital-life.com/awesome-wsl-wsl2-terminal/) by Christian for more tips on this method.

## Replace Git Bash with zsh

> This is my preferred choice as git bash is easier for me to maintain due to the [differences in the file directory with WSL](https://superuser.com/questions/1471994/git-bash-and-wsl-have-a-different-directory-structure). Most of my files are stored in the Windows file system and I use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) to manage my installation packages.

For this method to work, we need `pacman` but it is [not included](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/397#issuecomment-140984199) with _Git for Windows_ by default.

At this point, we have 2 options:

1. Install [Git for Windows SDK](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32712133/package-management-in-git-for-windows-git-bash/54740597#54740597)
2. or, download [pacman separately](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32712133/package-management-in-git-for-windows-git-bash/65204171#65204171)

Git for Windows SDK has a huge disk footprint of 5.33 GB as compared to a typical installation of Git for Windows which is only about 840 MB.

Hence, restoring pacman is a much more reasonable option.

### Restore pacman in Git for Windows

_Huge thanks to [Michael Chen](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32712133/package-management-in-git-for-windows-git-bash/65204171#65204171) _

1. Run the following commands to download /etc/pacman.conf and 3 packages: pacman, pacman-mirrors and msys2-keyring

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msys2/MSYS2-packages/7858ee9c236402adf569ac7cff6beb1f883ab67c/pacman/pacman.conf -o /etc/pacman.conf
for f in pacman-5.2.2-4-x86_64 pacman-mirrors-20201028-1-any msys2-keyring-1~20201002-1-any;
 do curl https://repo.msys2.org/msys/x86_64/$f.pkg.tar.xz -o ~/Downloads/$f.pkg.tar.xz;
done
```

2. Unpack them at the root then restore pacman with these commands

```bash
cd /
tar x --xz -vf ~/Downloads/msys2-keyring-1~20201002-1-any.pkg.tar.xz usr
tar x --xz -vf ~/Downloads/pacman-mirrors-20201028-1-any.pkg.tar.xz etc
tar x --xz -vf ~/Downloads/pacman-5.2.2-4-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz usr
mkdir -p /var/lib/pacman
pacman-key --init
pacman-key --populate msys2
pacman -Syu
```

3.  The next two commands restore all matching metadata. The second command is multi-line but still safe to cut and paste (be patient):

```bash
URL=https://github.com/git-for-windows/git-sdk-64/raw/main
cat /etc/package-versions.txt | while read p v; do d=/var/lib/pacman/local/$p-$v;
 mkdir -p $d; echo $d; for f in desc files install mtree; do curl -sSL "$URL$d/$f" -o $d/$f;
 done; done
```

4. Refresh pacman keys (to avoid [this issue](https://github.com/msys2/MSYS2-packages/issues/2058))

```bash
pacman-key --refresh-keys
```

5. Install zsh!

```bash
pacman -S zsh
```

6. Add the following line to `.bashrc` to switch from git bash to zsh whenever executing git bash.

```bash
bash -c zsh
```

7. Install oh-my-zsh, theme, plugins and all the good stuff!

   - I use a fairly simple [.zshrc](https://github.com/davzoku/dotfiles) config with [agnoster](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme) theme, and plugins like [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions), [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) _If you want to take a look at my latest configuration, you can check out [my dotfiles](https://github.com/davzoku/dotfiles)_.

## Extras

_Update: added this section after a week of using zsh on Windows._

### Using both Git Bash and zsh on Windows

After setting up zsh on Windows Terminal, I noticed that zsh is extremely slow within VSCode and freezes from time to time. As there isn't much documentation on this, so I have decided to fall back to using git bash in VSCode for the time being.

However, it seems that there is no simple way to load different `.bashrc` files so that I can switch between git bash and zsh easily.

This is a little hack to make this work.

1. comment out the line mentioned above in my `.bashrc` to switch to zsh

```bash
# bash -c zsh
```

2. Add a `switch-to-zsh.sh` script into my user directory

```bash
#!/bin/bash
bash -c zsh
```

3. Execute `switch-to-zsh.sh` only with Windows Terminal. by adding `"commandline": "C:/Program Files/Git/bin/bash.exe --login switch-to-zsh.sh"` to my Windows Terminal [settings.json](https://github.com/davzoku/dotfiles/blob/master/windows/windows-terminal/settings.json).

4. Viola! I get to enjoy the speed of running git bash within VS Code and use zsh on Windows Terminal!

_One caveat of this setup is that I have to maintain both `.bashrc` and `.zshrc` and make sure my alias and path variables are set up in both files. This is a fairly small cost for me to enjoy both shells on my machine._
