## Status

## Context

Developers interested in this repository may want to clone and start the project locally. Depending on their local configurations, they may find issues running the project.

**Should we invest effort to containerize this application?**

## Decision

- Containerize the repository with Docker so that anyone can run this project locally with a single command `docker compose up`.
- Serves as a sample implementation of anyone else who are also interested in dockerizing a Gatsby project.

## Consequences

- Reduce obstacles for anyone who wants to run this project.
