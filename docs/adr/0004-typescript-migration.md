# 4. typescript-migration

## Context

The codebase of the project is built on a Gatsby theme in Javascript.

**How should we migrate to Typescript without breaking any existing features?**

## Decision

### Convert codebase from Javascript to Typescript

- Serves as practice to convert existing project into Typescript (common use case in work environment)
- serves as sample implementation for other developers who are also interested in related migration works.

## Consequences

- Type-safe
- More predictable; reduce development time
- Steeper learning curve for those unfamilar with Typescript syntax
