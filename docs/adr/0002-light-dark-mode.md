## Context

The default Gatsby theme, Prist only comes with a default (light) styling. It is boring. Users should be able to toggle between light and dark theme depending on their preference.

**How should we support dynamic theming of the site?**

## Decision

### Be more ambitious

- Go beyond light / dark modes and add a collection of themes based on a memorable idea like "Mario Kart 64 race tracks"

- Come up with a central idea that is central to the developer's identity; eg. related to Singapore etc. So, visitors can associate the portfolio with the user easily.

## Consequences

- attractive and interesting UI
